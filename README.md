UK road signs as SVG and stylesheet variables

### SVG
Traffic signs are Crown copyright. They are part of legislation (Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002, often referred to as TSRGD). The numbers in the image file names relate to the TSRGD numbering.

You may reproduce traffic-sign images free of charge and without having to seek permission, but you must reproduce them accurately and not in a misleading context (eg not on roadside billboards where they could mislead drivers). You should also include a statement that these images are Crown copyright.

Please read the fuller conditions in the [[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/|Open Government Licence]].
